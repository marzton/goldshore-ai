## 2025-03-09 - Code Snippet Copy Accessibility
**Learning:** The simple `<button onclick="...">Copy</button>` pattern used for code blocks provides no state feedback and leaves screen reader users blind to success/failure. Using event delegation combined with dynamic `aria-label` swaps (e.g., from "Copy code to clipboard" to "Copied to clipboard") and managing `setTimeout` to revert state correctly ensures accessible micro-interactions.
**Action:** When adding copy mechanisms, always implement a visual and aria-label state change that reverts back using a managed timeout identifier. Ensure buttons have base type="button" and robust DOM selection techniques instead of fragile sibling references.

## 2025-12-14 - Polymorphic Button Accessibility
**Learning:** Found usage of `<a>` tags with `href="#"` for button-like actions in Admin UI, which breaks accessibility and semantics (no native `disabled` support).
**Action:** Refactored `GSButton` to be polymorphic (renders `<button>` when no `href`), enabling native `disabled` state and keyboard interaction.

## 2025-12-15 - Interactive API Console Fix
**Learning:** Found the "Try It" console in API docs was attempting to use server-side variables in client-side handlers (`onclick="send()"`), making it completely non-functional. Astro components separate server-frontmatter from client-scripts.
**Action:** Rewrote `TryItConsole.astro` using standard DOM manipulation in a `<script>` tag, enabling functional API testing. Added loading states, status badges, and response timing for a better developer experience.

## 2025-12-19 - Contact Form Accessibility
**Learning:** Standard HTML forms often lack explicit association between helper text and inputs, making them opaque to screen reader users. `aria-describedby` is the semantic bridge needed.
**Action:** Enhanced Contact Form with `autocomplete` attributes for faster completion and linked helper text via `aria-describedby` for robust accessibility.

## 2025-12-24 - Documentation Search UX
**Learning:** Documentation search bars are high-frequency targets for power users. A simple visual hint (`⌘K`) combined with a global shortcut significantly reduces friction and aligns with industry standards (e.g., Algolia DocSearch, MDN).
**Action:** Enhanced `DocsSearch.astro` with a `⌘K` keyboard shortcut, added visual hints using semantic `<kbd>` tags, and improved the "No results" state to reduce user frustration.
## 2025-12-20 - Navigation State Consistency
**Learning:** Visual active states (CSS classes) often lack the corresponding semantic `aria-current="page"` attribute, leaving screen reader users unaware of their current location. Also, "Index" pages often fail to highlight in navigation because of slug mismatches (undefined vs 'index').
**Action:** Enforced pairing of visual active classes with `aria-current="page"` and ensured root pages pass explicit context to navigation components.
## 2025-12-24 - Documentation Search UX
**Learning:** Documentation search bars are high-frequency targets for power users. A simple visual hint (`⌘K`) combined with a global shortcut significantly reduces friction and aligns with industry standards (e.g., Algolia DocSearch, MDN).
**Action:** Enhanced `DocsSearch.astro` with a `⌘K` keyboard shortcut, added visual hints using semantic `<kbd>` tags, and improved the "No results" state to reduce user frustration.
## 2024-05-21 - Active Navigation State
**Learning:** The documentation sidebar relied solely on text color to indicate the active page, failing WCAG 1.4.1 (Use of Color). Visual indicators must be redundant (color + shape/weight).
**Action:** Implemented `aria-current="page"` for semantic indication and added a left border + font weight change to `DocsSidebar` links for robust visual accessibility.
## 2025-12-24 - Nested Route Navigation
**Learning:** Basic equality checks (`currentPath === link.href`) fail for nested application routes (e.g. `/admin/settings/security` vs `/admin/settings`), causing the parent nav item to lose its active state.
**Action:** Implemented a robust `isActive` utility in Sidebar components that uses `startsWith` logic (with trailing slash normalization) to maintain context for users deep in a section.
## 2026-01-02 - Semantic Sticky Navigation
**Learning:** Sidebars in long documentation pages often lose context when scrolling. Sticky positioning combined with explicit `aria-current="page"` provides persistent context for both sighted and screen reader users.
**Action:** Apply `position: sticky` and `aria-current` to all sidebar navigation components to improve wayfinding.

## 2025-05-24 - Accessible Tabs
**Learning:** Tab interfaces often neglect keyboard navigation, failing WAI-ARIA standards. Users expect Arrow keys to switch tabs, not just Tab key (which should only land on the *active* tab).
**Action:** Implemented "roving tabindex" in `Tabs` component: only the active tab is focusable (`tabindex="0"`), others are skipped (`tabindex="-1"`). Arrow keys move focus and selection.

## 2025-05-25 - Interaction Interception
**Learning:** High-level overlay elements (like mobile menus) can inadvertently intercept pointer events for elements underneath even when visually hidden or partially obscured if not carefully managed, or if test scripts attempt to interact with covered elements.
**Action:** Ensure verification scripts account for overlay states by clicking clear "safe zones" or scrolling elements into view.
## 2025-01-31 - Accessible Code Copy
**Learning:** Code blocks often lack accessible copy buttons. Inline `onclick` handlers provide no feedback and are invisible to screen readers if opacity is managed only on hover.
**Action:** Implemented `MDXCodeBlock.astro` with a copy button that is visible on focus, uses ARIA labels for state ('Copy code' -> 'Copied'), and provides visual feedback via icon swap.
## 2026-03-01 - Accessible Overlays & Stacking Contexts
**Learning:** Elements designed to be accessible overlays (like skip links) can be visually obscured by fixed headers if their z-index isn't explicitly higher than the header's stacking context, even if they appear earlier in the DOM.
**Action:** Always ensure accessibility overlays use a high z-index (e.g., 9999) to guarantee visibility above all UI layers, regardless of DOM order.
## 2026-05-25 - Code Block Feedback
**Learning:** Standard Markdown rendering in Astro (`.md` files) often bypasses custom component mappings defined in `.astro` pages, limiting the ability to enhance code blocks with interactive features like copy buttons.
**Action:** Implemented a robust `MDXCodeBlock` component with global event delegation for copy functionality and accessibility (ARIA labels, focus states). Used manual `MDXCodeBlock` in `.astro` pages where `.md` limitations prevented automatic replacement.

## 2026-05-26 - Playwright Clipboard Permissions
**Learning:** Automated tests involving `navigator.clipboard` will fail in headless environments unless specific permissions (`clipboard-read`, `clipboard-write`) are explicitly granted in the browser context.
**Action:** When testing copy-to-clipboard functionality, always initialize the Playwright browser context with the necessary permissions.

## 2026-06-05 - Aria-Live InnerHTML Quirk
**Learning:** When turning a container into an `aria-live="polite"` region, avoid replacing the entire contents via `innerHTML`. Screen readers often miss the text change because the DOM nodes themselves are being destroyed and recreated simultaneously.
**Action:** To ensure robust screen reader announcements within `aria-live` regions, specifically target child nodes and update their `textContent` and `className` instead of replacing them wholesale.
## 2025-03-11 - [aria-live in Service Status Indicators]
**Learning:** Background polling operations, like system vitality health checks, can quietly pass updates onto the DOM that screen readers won't catch unless properly tagged.
**Action:** When adding automatic system status components (`ServiceStatus.astro`), always wrap the status text container in `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-atomic="true"` so its outcome (e.g., from "Initializing" to "OK") is cleanly announced.

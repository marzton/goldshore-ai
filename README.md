# 🟦 GoldShore Monorepo (README v2)

[![CodeQL](https://github.com/goldshore/goldshore-ai/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql/badge.svg)](https://github.com/goldshore/goldshore-ai/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql)

Unified platform for the **GoldShore** ecosystem, built with **Astro**, **Cloudflare**, and a shared design system. This monorepo ships the public website, admin cockpit, edge workers, and shared packages that power GoldShore in production.

- **Astro** (Web + Admin SSR)
- **Cloudflare Pages** (Frontend hosting)
- **Cloudflare Workers** (API + Gateway + Control + Agent)
- **KV, R2, D1, Queues, AI Gateway**
- **pnpm + Turborepo** (Monorepo orchestration)

This repository contains _all_ applications, shared packages, and infrastructure code used in production.
The GoldShore Monorepo powers the entire GoldShore ecosystem, including:
• Public Website (Astro + Cloudflare Pages)
• Admin Cockpit Dashboard (Astro SSR + GoldShore UI Kit)
• API Layer (Hono + Cloudflare Workers)
• Gateway Layer (routing, throttling, AI gateway)
• Agent Layer (Autonomous AI service)
• Control Worker (DNS automation, binding sync, deployments)
• Shared Design System (UI components, tokens, themes)
• Infrastructure (Cloudflare + GitHub Actions)

The monorepo uses:
• pnpm for workspace management
• Turborepo for task orchestration
• TypeScript everywhere
• Astro for frontend
• Cloudflare Workers for backend
• A unified theme + UI kit across apps

### Integrated Tech Stack

- **AI Models:** Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude (via Cloudflare AI Gateway).
- **Financial Data:** Alpaca, Thinkorswim (Planned Integrations).
- **Automation:** Jules-Bot (GitHub Hygiene), Sentinel (Security), GoldShore Agent (Background Tasks).

## Vibe Coding & Human-in-the-Loop

This repository embodies the **Vibe Coding** philosophy: rapid iteration, intuitive interfaces, and AI-assisted development. We follow a **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** approach where automated agents handle routine tasks, hygiene, and security, so humans can focus on architecture and creative problem-solving.

### Core Principles

1. **AI Augmentation:** Integrate best-in-class AI models (Gemini, Claude, GPT-4) via the Gateway and Agent layers.
2. **Resilience:** Infrastructure is built on Cloudflare Workers and Pages for edge-native performance.
3. **Security:** Automated scanning (Frogbot, Sentinel) and zero-trust access policies keep systems secure.

## Tech Stack & Integrations

### Primary Infrastructure

- **Cloudflare:** Workers (API, Gateway, Agent), Pages (Web, Admin), D1 (Database), R2 (Storage), KV (Cache).
- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD pipelines, automated PR reviews, and security scanning.
- **Turborepo:** High-performance build system for the monorepo.

### AI & Agents

- **Jules (Bot):** Internal automated engineer assistant for repo hygiene and refactors.
- **GoldShore Agent:** Autonomous service for background tasks and reasoning workflows.
- **Models:** Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude (via Cloudflare AI Gateway).

### External Integrations (Planned/Supported)

- **Alpaca:** Stock market data and trading APIs.
- **Thinkorswim:** Advanced charting and trading analysis.
- **Google Gemini:** Multimodal processing for content analysis and generation.
- **ChatGPT:** Conversational interfaces and support bots.

### Utility Extensions

- **GitHub Copilot** for inline suggestions.
- **Cloudflare Wrangler** for local Workers development.
- **Biome/Prettier** for formatting.
- **Jules Extension** (internal) via `apps/jules-bot`.

See [ECOSYSTEM.md](./ECOSYSTEM.md) for full details on extensions and integrations.

---

## **3. apps/gs-api – gs-api**

Hono-based API Worker.

```
Route: https://api.goldshore.ai/*
```

### Currently mounted route groups

The route-mounting source of truth is `apps/gs-api/src/index.ts` (the current repo path for the worker entrypoint referenced as `apps/api-worker/src/index.ts` in older docs).

```text
/health
  GET  /health            # shallow health check
  GET  /health?type=deep  # deep dependency health check

/user
  GET  /user/:id          # deprecated compatibility route; 308 redirects to /users/:id

/system
  GET  /system/status
  GET  /system/routing
  GET  /system/config
  PUT  /system/config
  GET  /system/version
```

### Planned endpoints

These endpoints are not currently mounted in `apps/gs-api/src/index.ts` and should be treated as planned only.

```text
GET   /version
POST  /auth/login
GET   /auth/session
GET   /content/:slug
POST  /queue/task
```

Bindings:

```
KV = gs-kv
R2 = gs-assets
D1 = gs-db
AI = AI (AI Gateway)
```

---

## **4. apps/gs-gateway – gs-gateway**

Request router + queue dispatcher.

```
Route: https://gw.goldshore.ai/*
```

Responsibilities:

- Reverse proxy → gs-api
- Queue ingestion
- Rate limiting
- JWT / Access token verification
- Preflight filtering (IP / SNI policies)

---

## **5. apps/goldshore-agent – gs-agent**

Autonomous AI Agent Service.

Responsibilities:

- Background reasoning tasks
- Integration with external AI models
- Complex workflow orchestration

---

## **6. gs-control – Privileged Infra Automation Worker**

System worker for automation:
### 5) `apps/gs-agent` — Autonomous AI Agent Service

- Background reasoning tasks
- External AI model integration
- Workflow orchestration

### 6) `apps/control-worker` — Automation Worker

```
Route: https://ops.goldshore.ai/*
```

- DNS updates
- Preview environment creation
- Worker deployment orchestrator
- Secret rotation
- Observability sync
- Cloudflare Pages operations
- Access policy / infra audit workflows
- Authoritative `GS_CONFIG` writes

`gs-control` stays deployed as its own worker on `ops.goldshore.ai`. It is privileged infra automation, not "just another API worker," and future consolidation proposals should keep `gs-api` focused on public and app-facing traffic.

```
Route: https://ops.goldshore.ai/*
```

# 🧩 Template Pages & Modules

Template pages are kept alongside each app so navigation, menus, containers, and search remain pluggable.

| App        | Template Location                            | Notes                           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Web        | `apps/gs-web/src/pages/templates/index.astro`   | Marketing + search composition  |
| Admin      | `apps/gs-admin/src/pages/templates/index.astro` | Dashboard shell + table samples |
| API Worker | `apps/gs-api/src/routes/templates.ts`    | Module checklist for API growth |
| Gateway    | `apps/gs-gateway/src/index.ts` (`/templates`)   | Routing + AI dispatch template  |
| Agent      | `apps/gs-agent/src/index.ts` (`/templates`)  | HITL orchestration template     |

---

# 🔗 Integration Matrix (Current + Planned)

GoldShore templates are designed to integrate with:

- **AI Providers**: Google Gemini, OpenAI ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude (via AI Gateway).
- **Operational Assistants**: Jules, GitHub Copilot, and custom HITL review workflows.
- **Cloudflare**: Workers, Pages, Queues, D1, R2, and AI Gateway.
- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions, GitHub Issues/Projects, and deploy previews.
- **Market Data + Trading**: Alpaca, Thinkorswim, Polygon, Tradier, and FIX gateways.
- **Ecommerce + CRM**: Stripe, Shopify, HubSpot, Salesforce, and outbound messaging.

Use these integrations to expand website management, SEO automation, admin analytics,
AI agent tooling, and market data services without rebuilding existing modules.

---

# 🧭 Continuity Tracking

To keep issues, workflows, PRs, branches, and components aligned:

- Track work in **GitHub Issues/Projects** and the templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
- Review deployment flow in `infra/github/workflows/`.
- Use `ops/pr-playbook.md` and `ops/maintenance-playbook.md` for release continuity.
- Document component ownership in the admin dashboard templates and UI kit README.

### Contributing Naming Rules

- Read `docs/conventions/naming.md` before opening a PR.
- Prefer `feat/add-new-worker-healthcheck` over mixed-case or space-separated branch names.
- Prefer package names like `@goldshore/api-worker` and workflow file names like `deploy-api-worker.yml`.
- Anti-patterns to avoid: `Feature/AddThing`, `gs_api`, `Deploy API Worker.yml`, and job keys like `deploy_api`.
- Use helper scripts:
  - `pnpm branch:bootstrap -- <type> <slug>`
  - `pnpm scaffold:worker -- <worker-name>`

## **packages/utils**
### `packages/utils`

TypeScript utilities:

- fetch wrapper
- env loader
- request helpers
- error handling

### `packages/auth`
[![CodeQL](https://github.com/goldshore/goldshore-ai/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql/badge.svg)](https://github.com/goldshore/goldshore-ai/actions/workflows/github-code-scanning/codeql)

Unified platform for the **GoldShore** ecosystem, built with **Astro**, **Cloudflare**, and shared UI/theme packages.

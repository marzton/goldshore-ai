# Workflow Inventory

Last audited: 2026-03-23

## Scope notes

- Active workflow directory: `.github/workflows/`.
- There is currently **no** `.github/AI/` directory in this repository; agent/governance content is stored under `AI/` at the repo root.
- `naming-lint.yml` is the active naming gate in this repo and serves as the practical equivalent of the planned `naming-guard.yml`.
- Deploy workflows with an on-disk `.disabled` suffix are intentionally disabled until they are renamed back to `.yml`.

## Blocking policy legend

- **Blocking**: Runs on `pull_request` and is intended to be configured as a required status check.
- **Non-blocking**: Manual, scheduled, push-only, issue-only, repository-dispatch, or advisory workflows not expected to block PR merges.

## Stabilization/disable procedure (real filenames)

When a workflow must be temporarily disabled, rename the actual existing file in place with the `.disabled` suffix so the repository inventory continues to reflect the exact on-disk filename:

```bash
mv .github/workflows/<real-workflow>.yml .github/workflows/<real-workflow>.yml.disabled
```

Re-enable by renaming the same file back to `.yml` when the workflow should become active again.
